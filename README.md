Phase 1: Data Analysis 
Objectives:
a)	Data Collection: The data came from a csv file where we found its data from the Internet to research the factors of people's body fat. We would then use said data to analyse and predict body fat.
b)	Data Preparation: To clean and remove unwanted data and redundant values so that it is useable for data analysis.
c)	Data Exploration: To use plots to visualise the data and find the unseen trends from the given data.

Phase 2: Data Mining and Prediction 

a)	Data Modelling: To use machine learning algorithms and make predictions of body fat using training data and test data.
b)	Validating Model: To predict the new dataset using the model.
c)	Result Interpretation: To analyse and understand the meaning and significance of data that has been collected through research and experimentation.
